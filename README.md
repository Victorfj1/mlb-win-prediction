# Predicting MLB Team Wins Using Statistical Modeling

This project analyzes historical Major League Baseball (MLB) team data to identify performance metrics associated with season wins and to build predictive regression models. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering (including a proxy OPS statistic), model comparison, multicollinearity diagnostics, and out-of-sample prediction.

The dataset spans team performance from 1871–2006 and includes offensive, pitching, defensive, and baserunning statistics.
